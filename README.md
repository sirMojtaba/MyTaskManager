# MyTaskManager
You can schedule and manage your tasks through this app which has been designed by **MVC** architecture and uses **ViewPager** and **TabLayout** to navigate between three TODO, Doing, and Done task lists. There have been used **Room ORM** to save information of a user and him/her tasks in the database and also **ImplicitIntent** to share the task details as a text to other apps.
