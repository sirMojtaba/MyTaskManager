You can schedule and manage your tasks through this app which has been designed by MVC architecture and uses ViewPager and TabLayout to navigate between three TODO, Doing, and Done task lists. There have been used Room ORM to save information of a user and him/her tasks in the database and also ImplicitIntent to share the task details as a text to other apps.
